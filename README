------------------------------------------------------------

1) THIS software has the following structure of directories:

 /bin - contains the executable file
 /src - contains the source code
 /include - contains the header files
 /obj - contains the object files generated after make
 /examples - some examples that can be run after installation
 /qwml - contains functions for writing QWML

2) OTHER files in the qwViz directory are:

 README - this file

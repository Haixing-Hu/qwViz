 qwViz 1.0 - Visualisation of quantum walks on graphs
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 Standard installation instructions:
 ----------------------------------
 1. In the qwViz directory, type the commands:
    cd src
    cp Makefile_Linux Makefile (or "cp Makefile_Mac Makefile" for Mac users)
    make

 2. To remove the object files after compiling, type the command:
    make clean

 3. It may be useful to add the bin directory to your default path:
    If you have installed qwViz in your home directory (~/qwViz) then you 
    need to do the following.

    In the bash shell, you need to edit ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc to 
    include the lines:
        PATH=$PATH:~/qwViz/bin
        export PATH

    For csh or tcsh, you can add the following line to ~/.cshrc:
       set PATH = ( ~/qwViz/bin $PATH )
 
 4. To test the install, examples in qwViz/examples can be executed using
   
    qwViz infile.adj or qwViz infile.qwml

 ******************************
 IMPORTANT: GRAPHVIZ DEPENDENCY:
 ******************************
 qwViz depends on Graphviz libraries, which are freely avaliable and licenced 
 on an open source basis (www.graphviz.org). A standard install of 
 Graphviz 2.26 from source code places the required libraries in /usr/local/lib
 and header files in /usr/local/include/graphviz. 

 Mac users can also use MacPorts to install Graphviz, in which case the required
 libraries will be installed in /opt/local/lib and header files in 
 /opt/local/include/graphviz.

 Using either of these standard Graphviz installations will allow the required
 libraries to be automatically linked at compile time.

 Non-standard Graphviz installation:
 -----------------------------------
 If for some reason, you do install the Graphviz libraries and header files 
 in these standard locations, you will need to modify the Makefile in to link 
 the libraries and include the headers at compile time. 

 It will be useful to know that:
 The Graphviz header file required is "gvc.h"
 The Graphviz libraries to be linked are "graph", "cdt", "gvc", "pathplan"

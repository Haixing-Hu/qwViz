# qwViz

Visualisation of quantum walks on graphs.

This code is originally taken from the folllowing paper:

Scott D. Berry, Paul Bourke and Jingbo B. Wang, [qwViz: visualisation of quantum walks on graphs](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465511002128), Computer Physics Communications, vol 182, issue 10, 2011, p2295â€“2302.

The v1.0 souce code could be downloaded from:

http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEJN_v1_0.html

Since the code was written many years ago, and it cannot be compiled under the recent OS X platform.

The author Scott D. Berry allowed me to port the code to the github and fix the compiling issues.

**Currently the code is not fixed yet, I will fix it when I have time.**
